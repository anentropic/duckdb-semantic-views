# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** A DuckDB user can define a semantic view once and query it with any combination of dimensions and metrics, without writing GROUP BY or JOIN logic by hand — the extension handles expansion, DuckDB handles execution.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Scaffold)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-23 — Roadmap created, ready to begin Phase 1 planning

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: v0.1 uses function-based DDL (`define_semantic_view`, `drop_semantic_view`) not native `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW` — parser hooks not available in DuckDB C API from Rust
- [Init]: Expansion-only scope for v0.1; no pre-aggregation; DuckDB is the execution engine
- [Init]: SQL expressions stored as opaque strings in the definition JSON; DuckDB validates them at execution time (avoids sqlparser-rs dialect gap)
- [Init]: Persistence via a plain DuckDB table (`semantic_layer._definitions`) in the user's `.duckdb` file; in-memory HashMap reconstructed from it at load time

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1 risk]: `duckdb-rs` vtab/replacement-scan API coverage must be verified by prototype in Phase 1. If gaps exist, raw `libduckdb-sys` FFI wrappers must be scoped before Phase 3 planning.
- [Phase 4 risk]: Re-entrant query execution in the vtab bind phase may not be allowed by DuckDB. Output schema must be inferred from definition metadata if SQL re-execution is blocked. Prototype needed early in Phase 4.
