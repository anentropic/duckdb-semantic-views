//! Differential proptest for the two-table star join / fan-trap fence
//! (code-review 2026-07-18 PBT-1 / "Top-3 new property #1").
//!
//! The single-table [`differential_proptest`] never exercises a join, so the
//! fan-trap safety fence (`expand::fan_trap::check_fan_traps`) — the code that
//! decides *which* metric/dimension combinations may be computed at the
//! root-anchored grain and which must be rejected — had no randomized coverage.
//! Its three leak-throughs (EXP-1/2/3) were exactly there.
//!
//! Shape: a `ManyToOne` star. The ROOT (base) table `t` is the FK/"many" side
//! (`t.fk REFERENCES u.id`); `u` is the parent/"one" side. Generated data
//! includes dangling and NULL foreign keys and NULL group keys / values. `u.id`
//! is generated distinct so the declared PRIMARY KEY holds in the data and the
//! LEFT JOIN never fans `t`.
//!
//! Two invariants are checked per case:
//!
//! 1. **Parent-table metric + child dimension ⇒ rejected.** `SUM(u.w)` grouped
//!    by `t.d` asks for a parent-grain aggregate at a grain below it: each
//!    parent row genuinely fans across the child values. Neither the root-
//!    anchored path (which silently inflated it — EXP-1) nor per-grain
//!    aggregation can define it, so `expand` MUST reject it with a
//!    fan-trap-family error.
//! 2. **Accepted query ⇒ numerically correct.** For every query `expand`
//!    accepts, the result must equal an independently hand-written oracle,
//!    compared as a multiset inside DuckDB via a symmetric `EXCEPT ALL`
//!    difference (the same type-agnostic, order-independent comparator the
//!    single-table harness uses). Since v0.12.0 that set includes queries
//!    carrying the parent metric `SUM(u.w)`: they are computed **at the parent's
//!    own grain** (`FROM u`, never through the join) and joined back to the
//!    child-grain aggregate, so the oracle is a per-grain one. This pins both
//!    halves — no inflation, and no over-rejection of safe queries.
