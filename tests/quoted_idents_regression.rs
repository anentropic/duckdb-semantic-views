//! Phase 64 regression test — quoted identifier handling.
//!
//! These inputs were the bug-report reproductions for Phase 64.
//! They must never regress: `plan_rewrite()` must accept each one and produce a
//! `RewriteAction::Create` whose stored view name is the bare unquoted last part
//! of the identifier (e.g. `"memory"."main"."orders_sv"` → `orders_sv`).
//!
//! Companion seed files for the libfuzzer target:
//!   - fuzz/seeds/fuzz_ddl_parse/seed_phase64_quoted_bare.txt
//!   - fuzz/seeds/fuzz_ddl_parse/seed_phase64_quoted_fqn.txt
//!   - fuzz/seeds/fuzz_ddl_parse/seed_phase64_mixed_quoting.txt
