//! T-14 (code-review 2026-07-16): a DIRECTED CRLF end-to-end body test.
//!
//! The lexer treats `\r` as whitespace (`is_ascii_whitespace`, `lexer.rs`), so
//! a CREATE body with Windows (CRLF) line endings is handled "by construction".
//! But that was only ever *implicit* — no test drove a CRLF body through the
//! real `plan_rewrite` CREATE front door, and the extra `\r` bytes are exactly
//! the kind of thing byte-offset threading (error carets) can silently
//! miscount. These two tests pin both halves:
//!   (a) a CRLF body parses to the *same* definition its LF twin does — no
//!       token is merged, split, or corrupted by the interleaved `\r`;
//!   (b) an error caret in a CRLF body lands on the correct *byte*, i.e. the
//!       `\r`s are counted in the offset rather than dropped.

/// entry. The CRLF twin is produced by replacing each `\n` with `\r\n`.
