DDL Errors (CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW)
=================================

These errors occur at define time when creating or replacing a semantic view.


Missing view name
-----------------

.. code-block:: text

   Missing view name after DDL prefix.

**Cause:** The :ref:`CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW <ref-create-semantic-view>` statement ends before a view name.

**Fix:** Add a view name: ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW my_view AS ...``


Expected AS or FROM YAML
-------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Expected 'AS' or 'FROM YAML' after view name. Use: CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW
   name AS TABLES (...) DIMENSIONS (...) METRICS (...) or: ...

**Cause:** The statement has no view name (``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW AS ...`` reads ``AS`` as the name), or has a view name but is missing the ``AS`` keyword or ``FROM YAML`` keywords before the body.

**Fix:** Use either the keyword body (``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW my_view AS TABLES (...)``) or the YAML body (``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW my_view FROM YAML $$ ... $$``).


Missing TABLES clause
---------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Missing required clause 'TABLES'.

**Cause:** The body does not include a ``TABLES`` clause.

**Fix:** Add a ``TABLES`` clause as the first clause in the body.


No DIMENSIONS or METRICS
-------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   At least one of 'DIMENSIONS' or 'METRICS' is required.

**Cause:** The body has a ``TABLES`` clause but neither ``DIMENSIONS`` nor ``METRICS``.

**Fix:** Add at least one ``DIMENSIONS`` or ``METRICS`` clause.


Unknown clause keyword
----------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Unknown clause keyword '<word>'; did you mean '<KEYWORD>'?

**Cause:** A word in the body does not match any known clause keyword (TABLES, RELATIONSHIPS, FACTS, DIMENSIONS, METRICS, MATERIALIZATIONS).

**Fix:** Check spelling. The error suggests the closest valid keyword.


Duplicate clause
----------------

.. code-block:: text

   Duplicate clause keyword '<KEYWORD>'.

**Cause:** The same clause keyword appears more than once.

**Fix:** Combine entries into a single clause.


Clause out of order
-------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Clause '<KEYWORD>' appears out of order; clauses must appear as: TABLES,
   RELATIONSHIPS (optional), FACTS (optional), DIMENSIONS (optional),
   METRICS (optional), MATERIALIZATIONS (optional).

**Cause:** Clauses are not in the required order.

**Fix:** Reorder clauses to: TABLES, RELATIONSHIPS, FACTS, DIMENSIONS, METRICS, MATERIALIZATIONS.


Unclosed parenthesis
--------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Unclosed '(' for clause '<KEYWORD>'.

**Cause:** A clause's opening parenthesis has no matching closing parenthesis.

**Fix:** Check for mismatched parentheses in the clause body.


Parser strictness
-----------------

.. versionchanged:: 0.11.0

   Several malformed statements that earlier releases silently accepted (dropping
   or mis-storing part of the input) are now rejected. If a statement that used
   to "work" begins to error after upgrading, it was almost certainly one of
   these:

- **Stray or leading commas** in a clause list are rejected -- ``DIMENSIONS (a AS x,, b AS y)`` and ``TABLES (,o AS orders ...)`` no longer silently drop an entry. A single *trailing* comma (``METRICS (a AS ..., )``) is still tolerated.
- **Malformed identifier slots** are rejected instead of being stored as unqueryable names: a whitespace-separated multi-token name (``o.d junk AS ...``, which used to name the dimension ``d junk``) and an empty quoted identifier ``""`` in a name or alias slot now error. An unqualified entry name whose expression happens to contain a dot (``region AS upper(o.region)``) now reports the missing ``alias.name`` qualifier rather than a misleading "Expected 'AS'".
- **Trailing tokens** after the view name on a name-only statement (``DROP`` / ``DESCRIBE`` / :ref:`SHOW COLUMNS IN SEMANTIC VIEW <ref-show-columns>`) are rejected -- ``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW a b c`` no longer executes and silently discards the extra tokens. ``ALTER`` sub-operations do the same.
- **DDL prefix keywords require a word boundary** -- ``DROP SEMANTIC VIEWS`` (plural typo) no longer drops a view named ``s``, and ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEWfoo`` is no longer recognized as ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW``.


.. _ref-err-name-uniqueness:

Duplicate or colliding names
----------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   duplicate name '<name>': <kind> '<name>' collides with <kind> '<other>'
   -- dimension, metric, and fact names share one namespace and are
   case-insensitive

**Cause:** Two items in the same semantic view share a name. Dimensions, metrics, and facts are resolved from one namespace at query time, so the collision may be within a kind (two metrics named ``revenue``) or across kinds (a dimension and a metric both named ``amount``). The comparison is case-insensitive, so ``region`` and ``Region`` collide.

**Fix:** Rename one of the items so that every dimension, metric, and fact name is unique (ignoring case).

.. code-block:: sql

   -- This will fail: "duplicate name 'Region': dimension 'Region' collides
   -- with dimension 'region' ..."
   DIMENSIONS (
       o.region AS o.region,
       c.Region AS c.sales_region
   )

   -- Fix: use distinct names
   DIMENSIONS (
       o.order_region AS o.region,
       c.customer_region AS c.sales_region
   )

.. code-block:: sql

   -- This will fail: "duplicate name 'Amount': metric 'Amount' collides
   -- with dimension 'amount' ..."
   DIMENSIONS (
       o.amount AS o.amount_category
   )
   METRICS (
       o.Amount AS SUM(o.amount)
   )

   -- Fix: use a distinct name for the metric
   DIMENSIONS (
       o.amount AS o.amount_category
   )
   METRICS (
       o.total_amount AS SUM(o.amount)
   )

.. note::

   The name uniqueness check runs at ``CREATE`` (and ``ALTER``) time, before the view definition is persisted. It is independent of the query-time duplicate checks described in :ref:`the next section <ref-err-query>`, which catch the same dimension or metric being requested twice in a single ``semantic_view()`` call. Semantic views created before this check existed keep working at query time: lookups resolve to the first declaration.


Graph validation errors
-----------------------

.. code-block:: text

   table '<alias>' cannot reference itself

   cycle detected in relationships: <alias1> -> <alias2> -> <alias1>

   diamond: '<alias>' is reachable from multiple tables ('<from1>', '<from2>');
   the join path is ambiguous. Declare the target under a second table alias
   so it is joined once per path.

   orphan table '<alias>' is not connected by any relationship; did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** The relationship graph violates tree structure requirements.

**Fix:**

- **Self-reference:** A table cannot have a relationship pointing to itself.
- **Cycle:** Follow the chain in the error message to find the circular dependency and remove it.
- **Diamond:** One target table is reached from two different source tables. Naming the relationships does not help; declare the shared table a second time under another alias (for example ``s_a AS stores`` and ``s_b AS stores``) so each path has its own copy. Several relationships from the *same* source table to one target are allowed; that is the role-playing pattern (see :ref:`howto-role-playing`).
- **Orphan:** Add a relationship that connects the table, or remove it from ``TABLES``.


Key missing on a relationship target
------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Table '<target>' has no PRIMARY KEY declared but is referenced by FK in
   '<from>'. Add PRIMARY KEY (cols) or UNIQUE (cols) to the TABLES clause for
   <target>. (v0.10.0: physical-catalog PK auto-inference removed -- see
   CHANGELOG.)

**Cause:** A relationship references a table whose ``TABLES`` entry declares neither ``PRIMARY KEY`` nor ``UNIQUE``. An explicit column list on the relationship (``REFERENCES <target>(<cols>)``) does not satisfy the requirement.

**Fix:** Declare the key on the target table's ``TABLES`` entry: ``c AS customers PRIMARY KEY (id)``, or ``UNIQUE (email)`` when the relationship joins on a unique column.


Expression references another table's column
--------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view: fact '<name>' references '<alias>.<column>', a column of
   table '<alias>', but a fact expression may only reference columns of its
   own table ('<own>'). To use a value from another table, define a FACT on
   that table and reference the fact by name (e.g. '<alias>.<fact_name>').

The same message is raised for a dimension or metric expression, with ``fact`` replaced by the member kind.

**Cause:** A fact, dimension, or metric expression names a raw column of a different logical table.

**Fix:** Define a fact on the other table and reference that fact by name. See :ref:`howto-facts`.


Unknown metric in a derived metric
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   unknown metric '<name>' referenced in derived metric '<derived>'; did you mean '<suggestion>'?.
   Available metrics: [<list>]

**Cause:** A derived metric's expression names a metric that the view does not declare, often a typo. The ``did you mean`` clause appears only when a declared metric's name is close enough to suggest.

**Fix:** Correct the name. The error lists every metric in the view.


LABELS on a metric
------------------

.. code-block:: text

   LABELS is not valid on a metric; it applies to facts and dimensions.

**Cause:** A ``METRICS`` entry carries ``LABELS = (FILTER)``. Named filters are row-level members, so only facts and dimensions can be labeled.

**Fix:** Remove ``LABELS`` from the metric. To reuse a filter condition, declare it as a fact or dimension with ``LABELS = (FILTER)``. See :ref:`howto-annotations-filters`.


Aggregate in FACTS
------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Fact '<name>' contains aggregate function '<func>'. Facts must be
   row-level expressions. Move aggregation to METRICS.

**Cause:** A fact expression uses an aggregate function like ``SUM``, ``COUNT``, or ``AVG``.

**Fix:** Move the aggregation to the ``METRICS`` clause. Facts are for row-level calculations only.


Circular fact or metric references
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   cycle detected in facts: <name1> -> <name2> -> <name1>

   cycle detected in derived metrics: <name1> -> <name2> -> <name1>

**Cause:** Facts or derived metrics reference each other in a cycle.

**Fix:** Break the cycle by removing or restructuring the circular reference.


NON ADDITIVE BY dimension not found
------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   NON ADDITIVE BY dimension '<dim>' on metric '<name>' does not match any
   declared dimension. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A ``NON ADDITIVE BY`` clause references a dimension name that does not exist in the view's ``DIMENSIONS`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the dimension name against the declared dimensions. The error suggests close matches when available.


Window metric inner metric not found
-------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   Window metric '<name>': inner metric '<inner>' not found in semantic view
   metrics. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A window function metric wraps another metric (e.g., ``AVG(total_qty) OVER (...)``), but the inner metric ``total_qty`` does not exist in the ``METRICS`` clause.

**Fix:** Ensure the inner metric is declared before the window metric. The error suggests close matches.


Window metric EXCLUDING dimension not found
--------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   Window metric '<name>': EXCLUDING dimension '<dim>' not found in semantic
   view dimensions. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A window metric's ``PARTITION BY EXCLUDING`` clause references a dimension that does not exist.

**Fix:** Check the dimension name. The error suggests close matches. All dimensions in ``EXCLUDING`` must be declared in the view's ``DIMENSIONS`` clause.


Window metric PARTITION BY dimension not found
-----------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   Window metric '<name>': PARTITION BY dimension '<dim>' not found in semantic
   view dimensions. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A window metric's ``PARTITION BY`` clause (without ``EXCLUDING``) references a dimension that does not exist in the view's ``DIMENSIONS`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the dimension name. The error suggests close matches. All dimensions in ``PARTITION BY`` must be declared in the view's ``DIMENSIONS`` clause.


Window metric ORDER BY dimension not found
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   Window metric '<name>': ORDER BY dimension '<dim>' not found in semantic
   view dimensions. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A window metric's ``ORDER BY`` clause references a dimension that does not exist in the view's ``DIMENSIONS`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the dimension name. The error suggests close matches.


OVER and NON ADDITIVE BY conflict
-----------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   Cannot combine OVER clause with NON ADDITIVE BY on metric '<name>'.
   Use one or the other.

**Cause:** A metric definition includes both a window function ``OVER (...)`` clause and a ``NON ADDITIVE BY (...)`` clause. These are mutually exclusive features.

**Fix:** Use either ``NON ADDITIVE BY`` (for semi-additive snapshot aggregation) or ``OVER`` (for window functions), not both on the same metric.


OVER clause not allowed on derived metric
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   OVER clause not allowed on derived metric '<name>'. Only qualified metrics
   (alias.name) can use OVER.

**Cause:** A derived metric (one without a table alias) has an ``OVER`` clause. Window metrics require a qualified name (``alias.metric_name``) because they need a source table for join resolution.

**Fix:** Add a table alias to the metric name: change ``my_metric AS AVG(total) OVER (...)`` to ``alias.my_metric AS AVG(total) OVER (...)``.


.. _ref-err-materialization:

Materialization Errors
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.7.0

These errors occur when validating the ``MATERIALIZATIONS`` clause.


Duplicate materialization name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   Duplicate materialization name '<name>'.

**Cause:** Two or more materializations in the same view share the same name.

**Fix:** Give each materialization a unique name.


Materialization dimension not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   Materialization '<name>': dimension '<dim>' not found in semantic view
   dimensions. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A materialization references a dimension name that does not exist in the view's ``DIMENSIONS`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the dimension name against the declared dimensions. The error suggests close matches.


Materialization metric not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   Materialization '<name>': metric '<met>' not found in semantic view
   metrics. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A materialization references a metric name that does not exist in the view's ``METRICS`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the metric name against the declared metrics. The error suggests close matches.


Empty materialization coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   Materialization '<name>': must specify at least one of DIMENSIONS or METRICS.

**Cause:** A materialization entry declares only a ``TABLE`` with neither ``DIMENSIONS`` nor ``METRICS``.

**Fix:** Add at least one of ``DIMENSIONS (...)`` or ``METRICS (...)`` to the materialization entry.


.. _ref-err-yaml:

YAML Errors
============

.. versionadded:: 0.7.0

These errors occur when using ``FROM YAML`` or ``FROM YAML FILE`` to create a semantic view, or when exporting with :ref:`READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW() <ref-read-yaml>`.


Dollar-quote errors
--------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Expected '$' to begin dollar-quoted string

   Unterminated dollar-quote opening delimiter

   Unterminated dollar-quoted string (expected closing '<delimiter>')

**Cause:** The ``FROM YAML`` body is not properly enclosed in dollar-quote delimiters.

**Fix:** Ensure the YAML content starts with ``$$`` (or ``$tag$``) and ends with the matching closing delimiter.


Trailing content after dollar-quote
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Unexpected content after closing dollar-quote: '<text>'

**Cause:** Extra text appears after the closing ``$$`` delimiter.

**Fix:** Remove any content between the closing ``$$`` and the statement terminator.


Empty file path
----------------

.. code-block:: text

   File path cannot be empty.

**Cause:** ``FROM YAML FILE`` was used with an empty single-quoted string.

**Fix:** Provide a valid file path: ``FROM YAML FILE '/path/to/file.yaml'``


Missing file path quotes
--------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Expected single-quoted file path after FILE keyword.

**Cause:** The file path after ``FROM YAML FILE`` is not enclosed in single quotes.

**Fix:** Use single quotes around the file path: ``FROM YAML FILE '/path/to/file.yaml'``


YAML size limit exceeded
--------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   YAML definition for semantic view '<name>' exceeds size limit
   (<size> bytes > <cap> bytes).

**Cause:** The YAML content exceeds the 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes) size cap.

**Fix:** Reduce the YAML definition size, or split the semantic view into multiple smaller views.


YAML parsing error
-------------------

.. code-block:: text

   invalid YAML definition for semantic view '<name>': <details>

For example, a definition without a ``metrics`` key fails with:

.. code-block:: text

   invalid YAML definition for semantic view 'sales': missing field `metrics`

**Cause:** The YAML content is not valid YAML or does not match the expected semantic view definition schema.

**Fix:** Check the YAML syntax and structure against :ref:`ref-yaml-format`. The definition must include ``tables`` and both the ``dimensions`` and ``metrics`` keys (use ``[]`` for one of them if the view has none), and at least one of the two must be non-empty.


.. _ref-err-query:

Query Errors (semantic_view)
============================

These errors occur at query time when calling :ref:`semantic_view() <ref-semantic-view-function>` or :ref:`explain_semantic_view() <ref-explain-semantic-view>`.


View not found
--------------

.. code-block:: text

   Semantic view '<name>' not found. Did you mean '<suggestion>'?
   Available views: [<list>].
   Run SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS to see all registered views.

**Cause:** No semantic view with the given name exists.

**Fix:** Check the view name. The error shows available views and suggests close matches.


Empty request
-------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<name>': specify at least dimensions := [...], metrics := [...],
   or facts := [...].
   Run DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW <name> to see available dimensions, metrics, and facts.

**Cause:** Neither ``dimensions``, ``metrics``, nor ``facts`` was specified in the query.

**Fix:** Add at least one of ``dimensions := [...]``, ``metrics := [...]``, or ``facts := [...]``.


Unknown dimension
-----------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': unknown dimension '<name>'. Available: [<list>].
   Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A requested dimension name does not match any dimension in the view.

**Fix:** Check the dimension name. Use :ref:`DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW <ref-describe-semantic-view>` to see all available dimensions.


Unknown metric
--------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': unknown metric '<name>'. Available: [<list>].
   Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A requested metric name does not match any metric in the view.

**Fix:** Check the metric name. Use :ref:`DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW <ref-describe-semantic-view>` to see all available metrics.


Duplicate dimension or metric
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': duplicate dimension '<name>'

   semantic view '<view>': duplicate metric '<name>'

**Cause:** The same dimension or metric appears more than once in the request. Duplicates are detected on the *resolved* item, so requesting both the bare and the table-qualified spelling of the same item (``'region'`` and ``'o.region'``) is also rejected.

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate from the ``dimensions`` or ``metrics`` list.


COUNT(*) on a joined table requires a PRIMARY KEY
-------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': metric '<name>' uses COUNT(*) on joined table
   '<alias>'. The generated LEFT JOIN produces one NULL-extended row per
   base-table row with no match in '<alias>', which COUNT(*) would count --
   so the expansion rewrites COUNT(*) to COUNT(<primary key>) for non-base
   tables, but table '<alias>' has no PRIMARY KEY declared in the TABLES
   clause. Add PRIMARY KEY (cols) to '<alias>' or use an explicit column:
   COUNT(<alias>.<column>).

**Cause:** A queried metric (directly, via a derived metric, or as a window metric's inner aggregate) is ``COUNT(*)`` on a table other than the base table. Generated joins are ``LEFT JOIN``\ s, so ``COUNT(*)`` would also count the NULL-extended row produced for each base row with no match -- silently inflating the result. The expansion protects against this by rewriting ``COUNT(*)`` to ``COUNT(<first primary key column>)`` for non-base source tables, which requires the table to declare a ``PRIMARY KEY``.

**Fix:** Declare ``PRIMARY KEY (<cols>)`` for the metric's source table in the ``TABLES`` clause, or define the metric as ``COUNT(<alias>.<column>)`` over a NOT NULL column.


Fan trap detected
-----------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': fan trap detected -- metric '<metric>' (table '<table>')
   would be duplicated when joined to dimension '<dim>' (table '<table>') via
   relationship '<rel>' (many-to-one cardinality, inferred: FK is not PK/UNIQUE).
   This would inflate aggregation results. Remove the dimension, use a metric from
   the same table, or restructure the relationship.

**Cause:** The query would traverse a one-to-many join boundary, inflating aggregate results.

**Fix:** See :ref:`howto-fan-traps` for detailed solutions: remove the problematic dimension, use a metric from the same table as the dimension, or restructure the view.


Fact reached across a fan-out
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': fan trap detected -- '<metric>' (table '<table>')
   references the fact '<fact>' on table '<fact_table>', and relationship
   '<rel>' fans out on the way there, so joining it would multiply '<metric>'s
   rows. Reference a fact on a table reachable without fanning out, or define
   the fact on '<table>'.

**Cause:** A metric references a fact on a table that sits on the "many" side of a relationship from the metric's table (for example, a metric on ``orders`` using a fact on ``line_items``). Joining that table would repeat each of the metric's rows once per child row.

**Fix:** Move the fact to the metric's own table, reference a fact on a parent (many-to-one) table instead, or define the metric on the child table. See :ref:`howto-facts`.


Ambiguous dimension path
-------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': dimension '<dim>' is ambiguous -- table '<table>'
   is reached via multiple relationships: [<rel1>, <rel2>]. Specify a metric
   with USING to disambiguate, or use a dimension from a non-ambiguous table.

**Cause:** A dimension comes from a table reachable via multiple named relationships (role-playing pattern), and no co-queried metric has a ``USING`` clause that selects one path.

**Fix:** See :ref:`howto-role-playing`. Add a metric with ``USING (<rel_name>)`` to disambiguate, or use a dimension from a table that is not a role-playing target.


Metric cannot be co-queried with a semi-additive metric
--------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': metric '<name>' (expression: <expr>) cannot be
   co-queried with semi-additive metric '<semi>': <reason>. Snapshot expansion
   for NON ADDITIVE BY requires every co-queried metric to be a single
   aggregate call SUM/COUNT/AVG/MIN/MAX(<expression>) without '*', DISTINCT,
   or surrounding expression text. Query '<name>' and '<semi>' separately.

**Cause:** The query mixes an active semi-additive metric (its ``NON ADDITIVE BY`` dimension is not in the query) with a metric whose expression cannot be decomposed for the snapshot CTE: ``COUNT(*)``, a ``DISTINCT`` aggregate, arithmetic around the aggregate (``SUM(x) * 0.1``), a wrapped aggregate (``COALESCE(SUM(x), 0)``), or a derived metric.

**Fix:** Query the two metrics separately, or redefine the co-queried metric as a single bare aggregate call (e.g. ``COUNT(<pk_column>)`` instead of ``COUNT(*)``).


Semi-additive metric expression cannot be expanded
---------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': semi-additive metric '<name>' (expression: <expr>)
   cannot be expanded: <reason>. NON ADDITIVE BY snapshot expansion requires
   the metric to be a single aggregate call SUM/COUNT/AVG/MIN/MAX(<expression>)
   without '*' or DISTINCT.

**Cause:** The ``NON ADDITIVE BY`` metric's own expression is not a single decomposable aggregate call, so the snapshot CTE cannot split it into a per-row column plus an outer re-aggregation.

**Fix:** Redefine the metric as a single aggregate call over a plain expression (e.g. ``SUM(a.balance)``).


Private metric
--------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': metric '<name>' is private and cannot be queried
   directly. Private metrics can only be used in derived metric expressions.

**Cause:** A metric marked ``PRIVATE`` was requested in the ``metrics := [...]`` list.

**Fix:** Private metrics exist for internal composition only. Query a public derived metric that uses the private metric, or recreate the view without the ``PRIVATE`` keyword. See :ref:`howto-metadata-annotations`.


Private fact
------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': fact '<name>' is private and cannot be queried
   directly. Private facts can only be used in derived expressions.

**Cause:** A fact marked ``PRIVATE`` was requested in the ``facts := [...]`` list.

**Fix:** Remove the ``PRIVATE`` keyword from the fact to make it queryable, or reference the fact only from metric expressions.


Cannot combine facts and metrics
----------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': cannot combine facts and metrics in the same query.
   Use facts := [...] OR metrics := [...], not both.

**Cause:** The query includes both ``facts := [...]`` and ``metrics := [...]``. Facts are row-level expressions; metrics are aggregated. These modes are mutually exclusive.

**Fix:** Run two separate queries -- one for facts and one for metrics.


Unknown fact
------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': unknown fact '<name>'. Available: [<list>].
   Did you mean '<suggestion>'?

**Cause:** A requested fact name does not match any fact in the view's ``FACTS`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the fact name against declared facts. The error suggests close matches.


Duplicate fact
--------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': duplicate fact '<name>'

**Cause:** The same fact name appears more than once in the ``facts := [...]`` list.

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate from the ``facts`` list.


Incompatible table paths for facts
------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. versionchanged:: 0.12.0
   The rule is now about row multiplication rather than tree position, and the
   message wording changed to match. Pairs that are reachable one way without
   fanning out -- a fact on a table that references the base table, with a
   dimension on a table the base table references -- are now accepted.

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': fact query references objects from incompatible
   table paths -- neither table '<table_a>' nor '<table_b>' can be reached
   from the other without crossing a one-to-many relationship, so joining
   them would duplicate the rows returned

**Cause:** A fact query does not aggregate, so it returns rows as they are. Reaching one of these two tables from the other means traversing a one-to-many relationship *against* its direction -- every row on one side matching many on the other -- and that holds whichever of the two you start from. The rows returned would silently be duplicates. The usual shape is two tables that both reference a third (``line_items`` and ``shipments`` both referencing ``orders``): joining both multiplies each one's rows by the other's.

**Fix:** Query the two tables separately. Facts and dimensions can be combined freely as long as one side is reachable from the other without fanning out -- a chain of many-to-one relationships in either direction is fine, however long.


Window and aggregate metric mixing
------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': cannot mix window function metrics [<window_metrics>]
   with aggregate metrics [<aggregate_metrics>] in the same query

**Cause:** The query requests both window function metrics and standard aggregate metrics. These produce different result shapes (row-level vs. grouped) and cannot be combined.

**Fix:** Run separate queries for window metrics and aggregate metrics.


Window metric required dimension missing
------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<view>': window function metric '<metric>' requires
   dimension '<dim>' to be included in the query (used in <reason>)

**Cause:** A window function metric references a dimension in its ``PARTITION BY EXCLUDING``, ``PARTITION BY``, or ``ORDER BY`` clause, but that dimension was not included in the query's ``dimensions := [...]`` list. The ``<reason>`` value indicates which clause requires the dimension (``PARTITION BY EXCLUDING``, ``PARTITION BY``, or ``ORDER BY``).

**Fix:** Add the required dimension to the query. Use :ref:`SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS FOR METRIC <ref-show-dims-for-metric>` to see which dimensions are required (``required = TRUE``) for a window metric.


.. _ref-err-concurrent-ddl:

Concurrent DDL Errors
=====================

These errors relate to :ref:`DROP <ref-drop-semantic-view>` or :ref:`ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW <ref-alter-semantic-view>` when another writer modifies the catalog around the same time.


Existence guard on DROP / ALTER (and its autocommit window)
-----------------------------------------------------------

A non-``IF EXISTS`` ``DROP`` or ``ALTER`` runs a small existence check before its ``DELETE`` / ``UPDATE``. When the view is absent at check time you get:

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<name>' does not exist

and ``ALTER ... RENAME`` additionally raises, when the target name is taken:

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<new_name>' already exists

**Cause:** The view was not present (or the rename target was already present) when the guard evaluated -- either it never existed, or another connection had already committed the change by the time your statement ran.

**A subtlety under autocommit:** the guard and the ``DELETE`` / ``UPDATE`` are separate statements. Under autocommit (the default) they commit independently, so a concurrent commit that lands in the window *between* them is **not** caught by the guard: a concurrent ``DROP`` leaves your ``DROP`` deleting 0 rows and reporting success, and a rename target taken in that window surfaces a raw ``Constraint Error: Duplicate key`` from DuckDB instead of the friendly ``already exists`` message.

**Fix:** Decide on the contract you want. Use ``IF EXISTS`` if a missing target should silently no-op (``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW IF EXISTS my_view``, ``ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW IF EXISTS my_view ...``). If you need the check and the write to be atomic under concurrency, wrap the statement in an explicit transaction (``BEGIN; DROP SEMANTIC VIEW my_view; COMMIT;``): all statements then share one snapshot, and a conflicting concurrent commit makes your ``COMMIT`` fail with a retryable transaction-conflict error instead of slipping through the window. See :ref:`explanation-transactional-ddl` for the full mechanism.


.. _ref-err-resolution:

Name Resolution and Catalog Errors
==================================

These errors come from how a view name is resolved to a schema, and from which database holds the semantic view catalog.


Unqualified name that is not on the search path
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic view '<name>' does not exist on the search path. It exists in
   schemas <schemas>, none of which are on the current search path (<path>).
   Qualify the reference as <schema>.<name>, or add the schema to search_path.

**Cause:** An unqualified reference resolves through the session's ``search_path``, the same rule DuckDB applies to an unqualified table name. A view of this name exists, but only in schemas that are not on the path -- so by that rule it is not visible from here. DuckDB would report a plain "does not exist"; this message says where the view actually is instead, because a bare not-found is confusing for something :ref:`SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS <ref-show-semantic-views>` plainly lists.

This applies to reads and writes alike, and ``IF EXISTS`` does not suppress it: that clause means "do not complain if the view is absent", and a view sitting off the path is not absent. Suppressing it would let a ``DROP`` silently remove one of several same-named views.

**Fix:** Either qualify the reference (``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW analytics.sales``, ``semantic_view('analytics.sales')``) or put the schema on the path (``SET search_path = 'analytics'``). When several schemas hold the name, the first one on the path wins.

**Note:** A view that is the *only* one of its name resolves whether or not its schema is on the path, so this error only appears once a second view shares the name.


Ambiguous name in GET_DDL or READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW
---------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   get_ddl: semantic view '<name>' is ambiguous: it exists in schemas
   <schema1>, <schema2>. Qualify the reference as <schema>.<name>

``READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW`` raises the same message with a ``read_yaml_from_semantic_view:`` prefix.

**Cause:** :ref:`GET_DDL <ref-get-ddl>` and :ref:`READ_YAML_FROM_SEMANTIC_VIEW <ref-read-yaml>` are scalar functions, so they do not follow ``search_path``. An unqualified name must match exactly one view, and several schemas hold a view of this name.

**Fix:** Qualify the name: ``GET_DDL('SEMANTIC_VIEW', 'analytics.sales')``. See :ref:`ref-get-ddl-resolution`.


DDL issued from an attached database
------------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   semantic_views: semantic-view DDL was issued against database '<db>', but
   the semantic view catalog lives in a different database. Semantic views are
   single-catalog: manage them from the database the extension was loaded
   into, without USE-ing into an attached database.

**Cause:** The session ran ``USE`` on an attached database, then issued ``CREATE``, ``ALTER``, or ``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW``. Semantic view definitions are stored only in the database the extension was loaded into.

**Fix:** Switch back to that database (``USE memory``, or the name of your file database) before running semantic-view DDL. A view body can still read tables from an attached database by qualifying them (``TABLES (o AS other.main.orders ...)``). See :ref:`explanation-txn-ddl-attach`.


.. _ref-err-wildcard:

Wildcard Errors
================

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

These errors occur when using ``alias.*`` wildcard patterns in ``dimensions``, ``metrics``, or ``facts`` parameters.


Unqualified wildcard
--------------------

.. code-block:: text

   unqualified wildcard '*' is not supported. Use table_alias.* to select
   all items for a specific table.

**Cause:** A bare ``*`` was used without a table alias prefix.

**Fix:** Use ``alias.*`` instead of ``*``. For example: ``dimensions := ['o.*']`` to select all dimensions from the ``o`` table alias.


Unknown table alias in wildcard
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   unknown table alias '<alias>' in wildcard '<alias>.*'. Available aliases:
   [<list>]

**Cause:** The table alias in a wildcard expression does not match any alias declared in the view's ``TABLES`` clause.

**Fix:** Check the alias name against the declared table aliases. The error lists all available aliases.


.. _ref-err-near-miss:

Near-Miss DDL Detection
========================

The extension detects near-miss DDL statements and suggests the statement you meant:

.. code-block:: text

   Did you mean 'CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW'?

   Did you mean 'DROP SEMANTIC VIEW'?

This triggers when the input is close to a valid semantic-view DDL prefix but contains a typo (e.g., ``CREAT SEMANTIC VIEW`` or ``DROP SEMANTC VIEW``). The detection uses Levenshtein distance with a threshold of 3 edits.
