How to Use Materializations
===========================

This guide shows how to declare materializations in a semantic view so that queries whose dimensions and metrics exactly match a materialization are routed to a pre-aggregated table instead of expanding raw sources with JOINs and GROUP BY. Materializations can improve query performance for common access patterns without changing the query interface.

.. versionadded:: 0.7.0

**Prerequisites:**

- A working semantic view with ``TABLES``, ``DIMENSIONS``, and ``METRICS`` (see :ref:`tutorial-multi-table`)
- A pre-aggregated table containing the pre-computed results you want to route to


.. _howto-materializations-concept:

How Materializations Work
=========================

A materialization maps a set of dimensions and metrics to a physical table that already contains the pre-aggregated results for that exact combination. When a query requests that exact set of dimensions and metrics, the extension reads directly from the pre-aggregated table instead of scanning raw tables, building JOINs, and computing GROUP BY.

The query interface (:ref:`semantic_view() <ref-semantic-view-function>`) does not change. Routing is transparent -- the caller does not specify which table to use. The extension decides based on the materialization declarations.


.. _howto-materializations-declare:

Declare a Materialization
=========================

Add a ``MATERIALIZATIONS`` clause after ``METRICS`` in the ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW`` DDL. Each materialization entry names a pre-aggregated table and lists the dimensions and metrics it covers.

First, create the pre-aggregated table:

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE daily_revenue_by_region AS
   SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS revenue, COUNT(*) AS order_count
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY region;

Then declare a semantic view with a materialization pointing to that table:

.. code-block:: sql
   :emphasize-lines: 12-18

   CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW order_metrics AS
   TABLES (
       o AS orders PRIMARY KEY (id)
   )
   DIMENSIONS (
       o.region AS o.region
   )
   METRICS (
       o.revenue     AS SUM(o.amount),
       o.order_count AS COUNT(*)
   )
   MATERIALIZATIONS (
       region_agg AS (
           TABLE daily_revenue_by_region,
           DIMENSIONS (region),
           METRICS (revenue, order_count)
       )
   )

The ``MATERIALIZATIONS`` clause must appear after all other clauses. The clause order is: ``TABLES``, ``RELATIONSHIPS``, ``FACTS``, ``DIMENSIONS``, ``METRICS``, ``MATERIALIZATIONS``.

.. tip::

   The pre-aggregated table must have columns named after the dimensions and metrics it covers. The extension selects columns by name from the materialization table.


.. _howto-materializations-routing:

How Routing Works
=================

Routing uses **exact match** logic. A materialization matches a query when both of these conditions are true:

1. The materialization's dimension set **exactly equals** the requested dimension set.
2. The materialization's metric set **exactly equals** the requested metric set.

Matching is case-insensitive. If a query requests ``region`` and ``revenue``, a materialization declaring ``Region`` and ``Revenue`` still matches.

When a match is found, the extension generates a simple ``SELECT ... FROM <materialization_table>`` instead of the usual JOINs and GROUP BY. When no match is found, the extension falls back to standard expansion against the raw tables.

.. code-block:: sql

   -- This query matches the materialization (exact dims + metrics)
   -- Routes to daily_revenue_by_region
   SELECT * FROM semantic_view('order_metrics',
       dimensions := ['region'],
       metrics := ['revenue', 'order_count']
   );

   -- This query does NOT match (different metric set)
   -- Falls back to standard expansion
   SELECT * FROM semantic_view('order_metrics',
       dimensions := ['region'],
       metrics := ['revenue']
   );

.. warning::

   Superset matching is not supported in v0.7.0. If a materialization covers ``[region]`` + ``[revenue, order_count]`` and a query requests only ``[region]`` + ``[revenue]``, the materialization does **not** match. The query falls back to standard expansion.


.. _howto-materializations-multiple:

Multiple Materializations
=========================

A semantic view can declare multiple materializations for different access patterns. The extension scans materializations in **definition order** and uses the **first match**.

.. code-block:: sql
   :emphasize-lines: 13-24

   CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW order_metrics AS
   TABLES (
       o AS orders PRIMARY KEY (id)
   )
   DIMENSIONS (
       o.region AS o.region,
       o.status AS o.status
   )
   METRICS (
       o.revenue     AS SUM(o.amount),
       o.order_count AS COUNT(*)
   )
   MATERIALIZATIONS (
       region_agg AS (
           TABLE revenue_by_region,
           DIMENSIONS (region),
           METRICS (revenue, order_count)
       ),
       region_status_agg AS (
           TABLE revenue_by_region_status,
           DIMENSIONS (region, status),
           METRICS (revenue)
       )
   )

Queries match whichever materialization covers their exact dimension and metric set. If two materializations cover the same set, the first one declared wins.


.. _howto-materializations-exclusions:

Routing Exclusions
==================

Two kinds of metrics are **always excluded** from materialization routing, even when a materialization declaration covers them:

- **Semi-additive metrics** (declared with ``NON ADDITIVE BY``): These require snapshot selection logic (ROW_NUMBER CTE) that cannot be pre-computed in a materialization table.
- **Window metrics** (declared with ``OVER``): These require CTE-based window expansion that depends on the queried dimensions.

When a query includes any semi-additive or window metric, the extension skips all materializations and falls back to standard expansion, regardless of whether a matching materialization exists.

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW account_metrics AS
   TABLES (
       a AS accounts PRIMARY KEY (id)
   )
   DIMENSIONS (
       a.customer_id  AS a.customer_id,
       a.report_date  AS a.report_date
   )
   METRICS (
       a.total_balance NON ADDITIVE BY (report_date DESC) AS SUM(a.balance)
   )
   MATERIALIZATIONS (
       balance_agg AS (
           TABLE balance_by_customer,
           DIMENSIONS (customer_id),
           METRICS (total_balance)
       )
   )

   -- This query falls back to standard expansion (semi-additive metric)
   -- even though a matching materialization exists
   SELECT * FROM semantic_view('account_metrics',
       dimensions := ['customer_id'],
       metrics := ['total_balance']
   );


.. _howto-materializations-verify:

Verify Routing with explain_semantic_view()
===========================================

Use :ref:`explain_semantic_view() <ref-explain-semantic-view>` to check whether a query routes to a materialization. The output includes a ``-- Materialization:`` header line that shows either the materialization name or ``none``.

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM explain_semantic_view('order_metrics',
       dimensions := ['region'],
       metrics := ['revenue', 'order_count']
   );

Sample output when routing matches:

.. code-block:: text

   -- Semantic View: order_metrics
   -- Dimensions: region
   -- Metrics: revenue, order_count
   -- Materialization: region_agg

   -- Expanded SQL:
   SELECT
       "region",
       "revenue",
       "order_count"
   FROM "daily_revenue_by_region"

When no materialization matches, the output shows ``-- Materialization: none`` and the expanded SQL contains the standard JOINs and GROUP BY.


.. _howto-materializations-inspect:

Inspect with SHOW and DESCRIBE
==============================

Use :ref:`SHOW SEMANTIC MATERIALIZATIONS <ref-show-semantic-materializations>` to list all materializations declared in a view or across all views:

.. code-block:: sql

   -- List materializations for a specific view
   SHOW SEMANTIC MATERIALIZATIONS IN order_metrics;

   -- List materializations across all views
   SHOW SEMANTIC MATERIALIZATIONS;

Use :ref:`DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW <ref-describe-semantic-view>` to see materialization details alongside all other view objects:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT object_kind, object_name, property, property_value
   FROM (DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW order_metrics)
   WHERE object_kind = 'MATERIALIZATION';


.. _howto-materializations-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
===============

**Query not routing to materialization when expected**

- Use :ref:`explain_semantic_view() <ref-explain-semantic-view>` to check the ``-- Materialization:`` line.
- Verify the dimension and metric sets in the query **exactly match** the materialization declaration (supersets and subsets do not match).
- Check whether any metric in the query is semi-additive (``NON ADDITIVE BY``) or a window metric (``OVER``). These are always excluded from routing.

**Materialization table has wrong column names**

The materialization table must have columns named to match the dimension and metric names declared in the semantic view. If the pre-aggregated table uses different column names, the extension cannot select from it correctly.

**DDL error: dimension or metric not found**

Materialization declarations reference dimensions and metrics by name. The names must match dimensions and metrics declared earlier in the same ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW`` statement. The error message suggests close matches.

**DDL error: MATERIALIZATIONS clause out of order**

The ``MATERIALIZATIONS`` clause must appear after ``METRICS``. Move it to the end of the DDL body.

**DDL error: must specify at least one of DIMENSIONS or METRICS**

Each materialization entry must declare at least one dimension or one metric. A materialization with only a ``TABLE`` and neither ``DIMENSIONS`` nor ``METRICS`` is rejected.

See :ref:`ref-error-messages` for the full list of materialization validation errors.
