A `Semantic Layer <https://www.databricks.com/blog/what-is-a-semantic-layer>`_ sits between your raw tables and the people querying them. Instead of everyone writing their own ``SUM(amount)`` and hoping they ``GROUP BY`` the same columns, you define each metric and dimension once, in one place. Analysts pick the ones they want; the system assembles the SQL.

Snowflake and Databricks, along with dbt Cloud, Cube.dev and others, all ship semantic layers in different forms. Snowflake has `Semantic Views <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-semantic/overview>`_ and Databricks has `Metric Views <https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/uc-semantics/metric-views/>`_. Both expose the semantic layer as a SQL object: a view-like interface over metrics and dimensions that you can query in any combination. This extension brings the same idea to DuckDB, using DDL syntax modeled closely on Snowflake's ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW``.

      Feature-by-feature comparison with Snowflake's ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW``.

If you are building a tool or an agent on top of the extension, every function it registers describes itself in DuckDB's ``duckdb_functions()`` listing, with its parameter names and an example call. :ref:`ref-functions` lists them and shows the query to run.
