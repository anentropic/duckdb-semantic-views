///     run; the loser's DELETE matches 0 rows and reports success having
///     deleted nothing (a silent no-op, not an error);
///   - concurrent RENAME — the loser's collision guard passes, then the
///     UPDATE hits `DuckDB`'s primary-key constraint and surfaces a raw
///     `Constraint Error: Duplicate key` instead of the friendly
///     `already exists` wording.
///
/// This guard window is accepted debt (TECH-DEBT #27), the DROP/ALTER sibling
/// of the CREATE race in #23. It is **not** closed by wrapping the rewrite in
/// an emitted `BEGIN … COMMIT`: `DuckDB` rejects a nested `BEGIN` (`cannot start
/// a transaction within a transaction`), so that wrapper would fail outright
/// whenever the caller is already in a transaction, and an emitted `COMMIT`
/// would prematurely commit an `autocommit = false` caller's in-flight work —
/// breaking the very transaction-participation contract the native-DML rewrite
/// exists to provide. Callers needing atomic check-and-write should wrap their
/// own DDL in `BEGIN … COMMIT` (the atomic path above).
///

/// existed" catalog pre-check (retired with H1 `catalog_conn`) AND (b)

///
/// The CTE form `WITH op AS (DELETE ... RETURNING)` is rejected by `DuckDB`
