//! Filter-clause parsing for `SHOW SEMANTIC ...` DDL statements.
//!
//! Extracted from `parse` (AR-1) so the god-module stays focused on
//! detection and rewrite dispatch. These functions parse the optional
//! `LIKE` / `IN` / `FOR METRIC` / `STARTS WITH` / `LIMIT` suffix of a
//! `SHOW SEMANTIC {VIEWS,DIMENSIONS,METRICS,FACTS}` command into a
//! [`ShowClauses`] struct, and render that back into a SQL `WHERE`/`LIMIT`
//! suffix ([`build_filter_suffix`]).
//!
//! `plan_ddl` in the parent module is the sole caller: it invokes
//! [`parse_show_filter_clauses`] then [`build_filter_suffix`] to produce
//! the rewritten catalog query. Single-quoted argument extraction is shared
//! with the rest of the parser, so it stays in the parent module and is
//! referenced here via `super::extract_quoted_string`.
