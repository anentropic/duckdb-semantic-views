/// Every synthesized join is a LEFT JOIN anchored at the base table, so a base

/// query fences that row inside each aggregate (SG-8 + `guard_aggregate_args`),
/// but a fact query and a dimensions-only `SELECT DISTINCT` emit rows
/// directly — the phantom becomes a result row that does not exist in the data,
/// and its NULLs are indistinguishable from genuine ones.
///
/// `member_tables` are the `source_table`s of the queried members (`None` means
/// the base table, which is never NULL-extended). The guard applies only when
/// they all name ONE table that is **below** the base — reached by following
/// foreign keys INTO the base, so it sits at a finer grain — and that table
/// declares a PRIMARY KEY. That table is then the query's grain, and filtering
/// to its real rows is exactly "anchor at the common grain table, joining up
/// for the rest", which stays fan-free because the walk from a child to its
/// parents is many-to-one.
///
/// The direction is load-bearing. A member on a table ABOVE the base (a parent,
/// reached by the base's own foreign key) is an ATTRIBUTE of each base row: a
/// base row whose foreign key is NULL or dangling is still a row of the view,
/// and its NULL attribute is part of the answer, not a join artifact. Filtering
/// there would delete real rows — `multi_hop_join_proptest` catches it
/// immediately. Below the base the situation is reversed: the base row has no
/// counterpart at the finer grain at all, so the NULL-extended row is
/// manufactured.
///
/// When the members span several tables the natural grain is ambiguous (a base
/// member legitimately keeps its row even with no child), and when the table
/// declares no PRIMARY KEY there is no column that distinguishes a phantom;
/// both keep today's behaviour. See TECH-DEBT #58.
