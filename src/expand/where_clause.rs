//! Resolution of the pre-aggregation `where_clause` predicate.
//!
//! Snowflake's `SEMANTIC_VIEW( … WHERE <predicate> )` filters the rows that feed
//! the metrics, *before* they are aggregated ("this filter condition is applied
//! before the metrics are computed"). That is not expressible by wrapping the
//! generated query in an outer `WHERE`: by then the aggregation has already run
//! over every row, and the members the predicate names are not in the output.
//!
//! Our query surface is a table function rather than a SQL construct, so the
//! predicate arrives as the `where_clause := '…'` named parameter. (`where :=`
//! is a parse error — `DuckDB` reserves the keyword in named-parameter position —
//! and `"where" :=` would force quoting at every call site. If the
//! `parser_override` hook ever accepts the real `SEMANTIC_VIEW(…)` construct,
//! the genuine `WHERE` keyword arrives there, inside our own syntax.)
//!
//! The predicate names declared *members*, not raw columns, so it is rewritten
//! into their expressions before emission — the same splice the derived-metric
//! path uses ([`crate::expr_tokens::inline_references`]), which is
//! quote/literal-aware, so a member name inside a string literal is untouched.
//! Each substituted expression is parenthesized, since the splice is textual and
//! the predicate is an operator expression — see [`resolve_where_clause`].
