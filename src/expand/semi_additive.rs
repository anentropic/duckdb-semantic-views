//! CTE-based expansion for semi-additive metrics.
//!
//! When any requested metric has a non-empty `non_additive_by` field AND at least
//! one of its NA dims is NOT in the queried dimensions, the expansion wraps the
//! base query in a CTE that uses `RANK()` to select snapshot rows before
//! aggregation. `RANK()` — not `ROW_NUMBER()` — so that when the fact grain is
//! finer than the queried dims (e.g. several accounts per customer, each with a
//! row at the same latest date), ALL rows tied at the snapshot ordering value
//! share rank 1 and aggregate together, deterministically (SG-4).
//!
//! **Effectively-regular classification (Snowflake semantics):**
//! A semi-additive metric whose ALL NA dims are present in the queried dimensions
//! is treated as "effectively regular" for that query -- no CTE needed, standard
//! aggregation applies. This matches Snowflake's behavior: "When the non-additive
//! dimension is included in the query, the metric is calculated as a standard
//! additive metric."
//!
//! The strategy for active semi-additive metrics:
//! - Single CTE (`__sv_snapshot`) containing all raw columns needed
//! - `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY non-NA-dims ORDER BY NA-dims) AS __sv_rn`
//!   (the `__sv_rn` column name predates the RANK switch and is pinned by
//!   sqllogictests -- keep it). The window's ORDER BY reverses each NA dim's
//!   declared direction so `RANK() = 1` lands on the LAST ordering value of the
//!   declared sort (ties included — see the RANK note above) — the default (ASC)
//!   therefore selects the latest snapshot and DESC the earliest, matching
//!   Snowflake (F-1, code-review 2026-07-16).
//! - Outer SELECT: regular/effectively-regular metrics use plain aggregation,
//!   active semi-additive metrics use `SUM(CASE WHEN __sv_rn = 1 THEN raw_val END)`
//!
//! Because the CTE decomposes every metric into an inner-expression capture plus
//! an outer re-aggregation, every metric in the query must be a single bare
//! aggregate call `FUNC(args)`. Anything else (arithmetic-wrapped, `COUNT(*)`,
//! DISTINCT, `COALESCE`-wrapped, multi-aggregate derived metrics) cannot be
//! decomposed and is rejected with a clear error instead of silently mangled
//! (SG-5).
//!
//! When multiple semi-additive metrics have different NON ADDITIVE BY dimensions,
//! each gets its own `__sv_rn_N` column in the CTE.
