uv run examples/readonly_load.py

Demonstrates v0.9.0 features:
  - LOAD semantic_views works on a read-only database.
  - Previously-defined semantic views can be queried via list_semantic_views,
    describe_semantic_view, and the semantic_view table function.
  - CREATE / DROP / ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW fail with DuckDB's standard
    read-only error rather than a confusing schema-create error at LOAD.

Two scenarios:
  1. Bootstrap a view in a subprocess (writable), then reopen the same
     file with read_only=True from the parent process and query it.
  2. Open a fresh (never-bootstrapped) database read-only and confirm
     list_semantic_views() returns an empty list (no error) and
     describe_semantic_view('missing') surfaces the standard
     "does not exist" error.

Both scenarios end by attempting a CREATE / DROP on the read-only
connection to demonstrate the read-only error message verbatim.

Why bootstrap in a subprocess? Phase 62's OverrideContext is attached
per-DBConfig and keeps the catalog connection alive until process exit.
Once the extension has been LOADed against a writable handle, the same
DB cannot be reopened read-only in the SAME process (the open hangs
because the Database is still referenced). Running bootstrap in a
subprocess sidesteps this by letting the OS reclaim the DBConfig at
child exit. This mirrors real deployments: bootstrap in a build/CI job,
then ship the read-only DB to a separate analytics worker process.
