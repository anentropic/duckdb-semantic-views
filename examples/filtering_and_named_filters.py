uv run examples/filtering_and_named_filters.py

Demonstrates v0.12.0 pre-aggregation filtering — Snowflake's
`SEMANTIC_VIEW( ... WHERE <predicate> )`, spelled here as the `where_clause`
query parameter:
  - why an outer SQL WHERE cannot express it, with the two numbers side by side
  - filtering on a member that is NOT in the output (the case that motivates it)
  - named filters: `LABELS = (FILTER)` members composed by name
  - parenthesized substitution, so a member's own operator precedence survives
  - the predicate applied inside each grain CTE of a multi-grain query
  - the boundary: a metric in the predicate is rejected

Each section prints both formulations where they differ, so the distinction is
visible rather than asserted.
