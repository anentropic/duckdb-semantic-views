uv run examples/per_grain_metrics.py

Demonstrates v0.12.0 per-grain ("own-grain") metric aggregation — each metric is
computed at the grain of its own table, the way Snowflake computes multi-grain
queries:
  - a metric on a PARENT of the base table, queried alone and grouped
  - metrics at two different grains queried together (fan trap)
  - metrics on two different child tables of one parent (chasm trap)
  - a derived metric whose components span grains
  - the boundary: a dimension below a metric's grain is still rejected

Each section prints the value the base-anchored formulation used to produce, so
the difference per-grain aggregation makes is visible rather than asserted.

#
# `orders` is the base table, so `customers` is a PARENT (its rows repeat once
# per order when joined from orders) and `line_items` / `shipments` are two
# CHILDREN of it — the chasm-trap shape.
#
# Carol has no orders; order 4 has no line items. Those absences are exactly
# what per-grain aggregation gets right and a base-anchored join does not.
