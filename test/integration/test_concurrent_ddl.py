Concurrent DDL race-guard regression test (v0.8.0, Phase 60).

Two threads each open the same file-backed DuckDB, BEGIN a transaction, and
attempt to CREATE the same semantic view name. DuckDB's primary-key constraint
on `semantic_layer._definitions(name)` serializes the inserts, so exactly one
thread must succeed and the other must see a clear conflict error.

Without the parser_override path emitting an INSERT against `_definitions`
(v0.8.0+), CREATE went through the legacy plan_function which committed
out-of-band — concurrency semantics were undefined. v0.8.0 keeps the same
serialization guarantee while collapsing onto a single execution path.

Scope note: these tests cover the CREATE / CREATE IF NOT EXISTS races only.
The non-IF-EXISTS DROP/ALTER existence guard (`SELECT CASE WHEN NOT EXISTS
THEN error('... does not exist')`) is snapshot-consistent with its DML only
inside an explicit transaction; under autocommit the guard and the DML commit
separately, so a drop landing in the window between them is not caught (the
DROP silently affects 0 rows). That guard window is a documented limitation
(FF-1 / TECH-DEBT #27), not something these tests pin — a deterministic
regression for it is not feasible because the window is inherently timing
dependent.
