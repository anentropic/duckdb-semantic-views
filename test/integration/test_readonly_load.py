Read-only database LOAD regression tests for the semantic_views extension.

Phase 63 (v0.9.0) adds support for `LOAD semantic_views` against a read-only
DuckDB database. Prior to this milestone, LOAD failed at init_catalog's
`CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS semantic_layer` with DuckDB's read-only error,
making it impossible to query a previously-defined semantic view from a
read-only DB (Iceberg snapshots, archival files, etc.).

Test scenarios (cover RO-01 through RO-05):
  (a) test_fresh_readonly_empty_list      — fresh read-only file, no
      _definitions table; LOAD succeeds; list_semantic_views() -> [];
      missing-view lookups produce a graceful "does not exist" / "not found"
      error (substring match — see RESEARCH §4 acceptance flexibility).
      Covers: RO-01, RO-03, RO-04.
  (b) test_bootstrapped_readonly_query_works — bootstrap a view writable,
      close, reopen read-only; LOAD succeeds; list/describe/semantic_view
      all return correct results.
      Covers: RO-01, RO-02.
  (c) test_readonly_ddl_fails             — bootstrapped read-only DB;
      CREATE/DROP/ALTER each fail with DuckDB's "read-only" error.
      Covers: RO-05.

Note on bootstrap-then-RO pattern: scenarios (b) and (c) bootstrap the DB
in a SUBPROCESS rather than the main process. Phase 62's OverrideContext
attaches a long-lived catalog connection to DBConfig that keeps the
DuckDB Database alive past the user's connection close, which prevents
reopening the same DB read-only in the SAME process (the open hangs on
the in-process database manager). Real users separate bootstrap and
read-only phases across process boundaries (CI build vs query runtime),
so the subprocess pattern reflects realistic usage. The same-process
RW-then-RO regression is logged in deferred-items.md as a follow-up
(Phase 64+ candidate).

    0 = all tests passed

    `shared_ptr<DatabaseInstance>` references that survive the caller's
