Phase 65.1 Plan 12 (WR-09 D-21) — `LOAD semantic_views` must be idempotent
across repeated calls within a single process.

`ParserExtension::Register` unconditionally appends to
`DBConfig::parser_extensions` (no dedup API), so without the
`sv_register_parser_hooks` idempotence guard added in Plan 12, every LOAD
would grow that list by one entry pointing at the same `sv_parser_override`
— an unbounded "soft leak" called out by 65-REVIEW.md WR-09.

DuckDB does NOT surface a double-register as a user error, so neither
LOAD call throws on the pre-fix binary; the symptom is internal list
bloat which isn't user-visible. The structural pre/post-fix discriminator
lives in `tests/parser_hook_idempotent.rs` (B-07 plan-checker fix —
counts parser-extension entries via the `sv_count_parser_extensions`
helper FFI).

This Python test pins the BEHAVIOURAL contract: a second `LOAD
semantic_views` in the same process must (a) not throw, and (b) leave
the parser-override hook functional so subsequent DDL still flows
through the `sv_parser_override` rewrite path. A regression where list
bloat caused a downstream parser failure (e.g. ambiguous override
dispatch) would surface as the sentinel DDL block failing.

Exit codes:
    0 = test passed (including pytest SKIP convention if run directly)
    1 = test failed
