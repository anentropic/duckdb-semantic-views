Differential-testing harness (TC-2, code-review 2026-07-02).

Compares `semantic_view()` results against independently hand-written
SQL over a seeded, randomized star schema — thousands of rows with NULL
foreign keys, NULL measures, and skewed group sizes. Every bounded
combination of requested dimensions and metrics is executed through both
paths and the result multisets must match exactly (floats within 1e-9
relative tolerance).

This harness is the acceptance net for the Phase R1 expansion-correctness
work: SQL-string shape assertions can't prove the generated SQL computes
the right numbers; this does.

SCOPE (deliberate): the schema and requests stay inside the engine's
*supported core* — all metrics live on the base (fact) table, dimension
tables hang off it via ManyToOne PK relationships, one grain. Scenarios
the 2026-07-02 review identified as broken (multi-grain metric×metric
fan-out SG-1, COUNT(*) on child tables SG-8, semi-additive ties SG-4, …)
are intentionally NOT generated here yet — each R1 fix PR must extend
this harness with the scenario it repairs, using this file's helpers.

Extensions so far:
  - SG-3 (single-pass derived-metric inlining): `net_revenue` is derived
    from metrics whose expressions contain a column (`o.amount`) named
    like another metric (`amount`) — the exact re-scan poison scenario.
  - SG-2 (declaration-order-independent join emission): the `cat_name`
    dimension is two joins away (orders -> products -> categories) with
    the p->cat relationship declared FIRST — pre-fix this emitted a
    forward-referencing join and dropped the o->p connecting join.
  - E-1 + SG-4 (code-review 2026-07-11, T-1): semi-additive snapshot
    section over a seeded snapshots table with (a) a dimension whose
    expression differs from its bare column (`upper(s.region)` over
    mixed-case region values — the E-1 alias-shadowing poison: pre-fix
    the RANK() partitioned on the raw column) and (b) guaranteed ties at
    the snapshot date within groups (the SG-4 RANK-vs-ROW_NUMBER
    distinction only matters with ties). Reference SQL uses an
    independent MAX-date semi-join formulation, not RANK.
  - T-1 window-metric section: running totals compared against a
    hand-written aggregate-then-window reference.
  - T-1 wildcard section: `['*']` requests must equal the explicit
    full-list requests (routing equivalence, incl. a window metric).

Usage:
    uv run test/integration/test_differential.py

Exit codes:
    0 = every combination matched
    1 = at least one mismatch (details printed)
