"""
Multi-database isolation regression test for the semantic_views extension.

Loading the extension into more than one database in the same process must
keep each database's DDL routing isolated. Pre-fix the C++ shim held a
single file-static `sv_ddl_conn`; the second LOAD overwrote it, so any
DESCRIBE / SHOW SEMANTIC * statement on the first database silently
executed against the second database's connection.

After the fix, the per-load `ddl_conn` lives on `SemanticViewsParserInfo`
and is threaded through `TableFunction::function_info` to `sv_ddl_bind`,
so every DDL routes to the correct database.

Test scenario:
  1. Create two file-backed databases with distinct semantic views.
  2. Run DESCRIBE / list_semantic_views on each connection.
  3. Assert each connection sees its own view and only its own view.

Without the fix, DESCRIBE on the first connection would either return the
second DB's view metadata or raise a confusing error.

Exit codes:
    0 = all tests passed
    1 = at least one test failed
