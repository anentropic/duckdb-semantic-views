Concurrent per-call Connection regression for the read-side migration
(Phase 65 Plan 05 Batch 3).

After Batch 2 (16 of 17 migrations) and Batch 3 (H2 query_conn retired +
17 dead VTab/VScalar carcasses purged), every read-side bind callback
opens its own per-call `Connection(*context.db)` on the C++ side and
bridges to Rust via a reinterpret_cast borrow of the stack Connection
pointer (see `src/ddl/list.rs` file-level docs). This test stresses the
borrow contract under concurrency: 8 Python threads × 10 calls each =
80 calls of `SHOW SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS FROM v1`. Each call hits the
catalog through its own per-call Connection; none of the threads share
a long-lived extension-owned `duckdb_connection` after Plan 05 ships.

The test asserts:
- All 80 calls succeed (no `duckdb_disconnect` UB on borrowed handles,
  no panic propagation across the C++↔Rust boundary, no catalog-lookup
  failures under contention).
- All 80 result sets are byte-identical (the per-call Connection model
  preserves snapshot-consistent reads — each cursor sees the same row
  set in the absence of concurrent writers).
- Wall-clock duration is under 30 s (catches a regression where the
  per-call Connection becomes synchronously serialised behind a shared
  mutex).

Exit codes:
    0 = test passed
    1 = test failed
