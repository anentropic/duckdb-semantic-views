Concurrent per-call Connection writes regression (Phase 65.1 Plan 05, WR-04).

Companion to ``test_concurrent_reads_per_call_conn.py`` covering the writes
side of the per-call Connection model introduced in Phase 65. N threads
each cycle through a mix of ``CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW IF NOT EXISTS``,
``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW IF EXISTS``, and ``ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW ... SET COMMENT``
on **overlapping** view names (``v_0`` .. ``v_3``) so 8 threads contend on
only 4 names — maximising the race-guard SQL surface and the
``INSERT OR IGNORE``/``json_merge_patch`` paths exercised on the caller's
connection.

Per-call outcomes are categorised into five buckets:

- ``success`` — the operation completed without error.
- ``already_exists`` — caught error matching the canonical "already exists"
  wording (from the race-guard SQL emitted by ``parser_override``).
- ``constraint_violation`` — PK violation per TECH-DEBT 23 (D-20). When two
  ``CREATE IF NOT EXISTS`` transactions both evaluate against a snapshot
  in which the row is absent and both attempt the INSERT, the loser sees
  either ``Constraint Error: Duplicate key "name: v_X" violates primary
  key constraint`` (single-statement check-time path) or
  ``TransactionContext Error: Failed to commit: PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE
  constraint violation: duplicate key "v_X"`` (commit-time path from the
  race-guard rewrite). Both shapes are documented behaviour.
- ``tuple_conflict`` — DuckDB's optimistic-concurrency rollback for two
  transactions that both wrote to (DELETE / UPDATE) the same row of
  ``semantic_layer._definitions``. Surfaces as
  ``TransactionContext Error: Conflict on tuple deletion!`` for racing
  DROPs and ALTERs on the same view name. Documented as the upstream
  serialisation contract — semantic-view writes against
  ``_definitions(name)`` PK serialise the same way any other
  concurrent DDL does.
- ``unknown_error`` — anything else. The test fails loudly with the full
  diagnostic text on any unknown error.

The test asserts:

1. Zero ``unknown_error`` outcomes — any unexpected error shape fails the
   test with full repr of the exception.
2. No thread hangs — all threads ``join()`` within ``WALL_BUDGET_SECONDS``
   plus a small slack budget.
3. Final-state check: ``list_semantic_views()`` content is a subset of the
   union of ``success``-marked CREATEs (so we did not conjure rows from
   nowhere). Exact equality is intentionally NOT asserted — race ordering
   means a thread's CREATE may be followed by another thread's DROP, so
   the strict invariant is "no spurious rows", not "exactly the union
   minus drops" (researcher Pitfall 4 / Assumption A4).
