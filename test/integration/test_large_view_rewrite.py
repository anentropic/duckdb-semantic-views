Regression test for the v0.8.0 silent-truncation bug in the parser_override
buffer path.

Pre-fix the C++ shim allocated a fixed 64 KB std::string for the rewritten
SQL emitted by sv_parser_override_rust, and the Rust-side `write_to_buffer`
helper silently truncated anything over the cap. For semantic views with
many metrics / dimensions, the rewritten
``INSERT INTO semantic_layer._definitions VALUES ('<name>', '<json>')``
exceeded 64 KB, the C++ side reparsed a truncated SQL string, and DuckDB
surfaced a confusing ``Parser Error: syntax error at or near …`` instead
of either succeeding or producing a real diagnostic.

Post-fix the FFI hands the C++ caller a heap-owned byte buffer (no cap),
released via ``sv_free_buffer`` through an RAII guard.

This test creates a view with enough metrics to push the rewritten INSERT
well past 64 KB, runs it inside a transaction (exercising the
parser_override path that the fix targets), and verifies it commits
cleanly and produces the expected metric count.

Usage:
    uv run test/integration/test_large_view_rewrite.py

Exit codes:
    0 = passed
    1 = failed
