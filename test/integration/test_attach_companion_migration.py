FF-3 (code-review 2026-07-02): the v0.1.0 companion-file migration must never
touch an ATTACHed database.

`init_catalog` imports a sibling `<db>.semantic_views` JSON file into
`semantic_layer._definitions` and then DELETES it. Before FF-3, `init_extension`
resolved the DB path as the FIRST non-empty file from `PRAGMA database_list` —
which, with an in-memory primary and a file-backed ATTACHed database, was the
ATTACHed file. The migration then slurped the attached DB's companion into the
(ephemeral) in-memory primary catalog and `remove_file`'d the source:
cross-catalog data loss. FF-3 ties the migration to the PRIMARY database's own
path (the `database_list` row matching `current_database()` on the load
connection) and skips migration entirely when the primary is in-memory.

  T1: in-memory primary + file-backed ATTACHed DB with a companion file —
      after LOAD, the attached companion is UNTOUCHED and its rows are NOT
      migrated into the in-memory primary.
  T2: file-backed PRIMARY with its own companion still migrates correctly
      (regression guard: the legitimate primary migration is preserved).

Exit codes: 0 = all passed, 1 = at least one failed.
