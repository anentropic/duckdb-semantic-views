Phase 65.1 Plan 04 — WR-03 integration test (decision D-18).

When DROP SEMANTIC VIEW or ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW runs against a fresh
read-only database that was never bootstrapped (no ``semantic_layer._definitions``
table), the user must see the canonical "semantic view 'X' does not exist"
error wording, NOT the raw "Catalog Error: Table _definitions does not
exist" leak. Phase 65.1 Plan 04 lands the outer-CASE wrap in
``src/parse.rs::existence_guard_select`` and this test pins the user-visible
contract:

  1. ``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW nonexistent`` (no IF EXISTS) errors with substring
     ``semantic view 'nonexistent' does not exist`` AND the error message
     does NOT contain ``_definitions`` (the leakage we are fixing).
  2. ``ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW nonexistent SET COMMENT = 'x'`` errors with
     the same substring and the same absence of ``_definitions``.
  3. ``DROP SEMANTIC VIEW IF EXISTS nonexistent`` on the same DB shape
     does NOT leak ``_definitions`` (W-06). Acceptable outcomes are
     either silent success OR an error carrying the canonical
     "semantic view 'X' does not exist" wording — both satisfy the
     "user never sees the implementation detail" contract WR-03 targets.
     The pure-SQL rewrite cannot reach silent success in this corner
     case because SQL cannot conditionally skip a DML statement; the
     IF EXISTS guard therefore errors with the canonical wording when
     ``_definitions`` is missing. The silent-no-op contract is
     preserved for the missing-row-but-table-present case (covered by
     phase45_alter_comment.test / v080_transactional_ddl.test).

The DB is freshly created (a minimal DuckDB header — single SELECT 1
through a no-extension connection — so the file exists with a valid
header). The semantic_views extension is NEVER LOADed on a writable
handle, so ``init_catalog`` never runs and ``semantic_layer._definitions``
is never created. We then reopen the same file with ``read_only=True``
and LOAD the extension. Because the RO open skips the writable
``init_catalog`` path, ``_definitions`` is genuinely absent. The
DROP/ALTER guard SQL then has to short-circuit on the missing table —
this is the exact WR-03 reproduction.
